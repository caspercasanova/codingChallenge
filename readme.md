# BMP Negative Swap
The purpose of this app was to satisfy a coding challenge for a company that will go unnamed. The main objective is to create a photo negative from an image stored in the BMP File Format. 

## Description

The Objectives are as follow:
  - The Program must be non-destructive
  - Assume non-compressed images 
  - Handles Errors Appropriately
  - KISS Keep It Simple Stupid (Rhetorical Explanation)
  - NO USE OF EXTERNAL IMAGE PROCESSING LIBRARIES

## Getting Started
The Project comes with 2 Test Images

If you want to invert a custom BMP of yours challenge
  - Add the file to the /images directory
  - In src/index.ts
