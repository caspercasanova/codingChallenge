# BMP Negative made by [Nicholas Lopez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/310-nicholas-lopez/)

The purpose of this app was to satisfy a coding challenge for a company that will go unnamed. The main objective is to create a photo negative from an image stored in the BMP File Format. 

The Project comes with 2 Test Images and you can add your own if you'd like. 

# Description

The Objectives are as follow:
  - The Program must be non-destructive
  - Assume non-compressed images 
  - Handles Errors Appropriately
  - KISS Keep It Simple Stupid (Rhetorical Explanation)
  - NO USE OF EXTERNAL IMAGE PROCESSING LIBRARIES


# Executing program

### To get started
Clone the Repo. 

1. In console @ root dir type and enter `npm install`
2. In console @ root dir run `npm run start`
3. Presto! The Image-Negative should be in the /negatives folder

> Note: If you want to convert your own image, add the image to the /images/dir and change the path accordingly in the code. Visit src/index for More Directions

* You can also run the test entering in the console `npm run test`
